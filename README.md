In this project i take in a excel sheet providing coffee sales across many different variables including customer, coffee name, coffee roast and weight and create a dashboard for the total sales, sales by country and top 5 customers at any given time





here is a before and after of the data cleaning that i did to make sure i was able to easily build my dashbaord, all collumns that i made utizile key functions such as XLOOKKUP, IF ELSE statemets and MATCH function to look up data between the multiple sheets to conjoin the data so i can group it and make my Pivot Tables and visuals


Here is the data that was given to me (NOTE: for these screenshots there is about 1000 rows so i cant show everything)
